# Hands-on Machine Learning Solutions for Journalists

This code supports workshops taught by members of the Quartz AI Studio for getting journalists learning machine learning.

## Module One : Using off-the-shelf tools for images

- Solve problems such as getting descriptions of each photo in a folder full of images, extracting text appearing in those images, or understanding the content of a folder full of documents

- [x]    Basic AI concepts tailored to journalism projects
- [x]    Getting started with Google Colaboratory notebooks
- [x]    Multi-category image detection with open-source tools
- [x]    Multi-category image detection using Google Vision

## Module Two : Making a custom image detector

-   Make custom detectors specific to your investigation.

- []   Introduction to transfer learning and fast.ai
- []    Training a custom model to sort images
- []    Using your own data & saving your work
- []    Discussion: Data as images

## Module Three : Improving your detector & detecting objects in videos

- Training a machine-learning model to work well is pretty straightforward. Getting it to work even better, or to fix problems when they arise, takes more craft

- []    Finding particular objects or scenes inside videos
- []    Improving the accuracy of your model

## Module Four : Analyzing text documents

-  sort documents into two piles based on their contents?

- []    Entity extraction using open-source libraries
- []    Sorting tweets into useful piles
