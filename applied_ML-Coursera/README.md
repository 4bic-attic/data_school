# Applied Machine Learning in Python

This course is offered by [University of Michigan](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-machine-learning) and taught by :[Kevyn Collins-Thompson](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/kevyn-ct), Associate Professor,school of Information

## About this Course

This course will focus more on the techniques and methods than on the statistics behind these methods.

It covers :

- How machine learning is different than descriptive statistics.
- Introduction to  the scikit learn toolkit.
- The issue of dimensionality of data.
- Clustering of data as well as evaluating those clusters.
- Supervised approaches for creating predictive models.
- Predictive modelling methods related to data generalizability (e.g. cross validation, overfitting).
- More advanced techniques, such as building ensembles, and practical limitations of predictive models.

## Goals :

By the end of this course, students will be able to;
- Identify the difference between a supervised (classification) and unsupervised (clustering) technique.
- Identify which technique they need to apply for a particular dataset and need.
- Engineer features to meet that need.
- Write python code to carry out an analysis.
