This repositry contains the python versions of the programming assignments for the [Machine Learning online class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) taught by Professor Andrew Ng. it is  one of the Machine learning classes any interested student can take to get started with machine learning.

- The assignments use [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html), which provides an intuitive flow easier than the original MATLAB/OCTAVE assignments.

## The Assignments

Each assignment is contained in a separate folder. For example, assignment 1 is contained within the folder `Exercise1`.

## Requirements

These assignments has been tested and developed using the following libraries:

    - python==3.6.4
    - numpy==1.13.3
    - scipy==1.0.0
    - matplotlib==2.1.2
    - jupyter==1.0.0
    - jupyter-client==5.0.1

## Python Tutorials

If you are new to python and to `jupyter` notebooks, no worries! There is a plethora of tutorials and documentation to get you started. Here are a few links which might be of help:

- [Python Programming](https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-to-python-programming/): A turorial with videos about the basics of python.

- [Numpy and matplotlib tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/): We will be using numpy extensively for matrix and vector operations. This is great tutorial to get you started with using numpy and matplotlib for plotting.

- [Jupyter notebook](https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/getting-started-with-jupyter-notebook-for-python-4e7082bd5d46): Getting started with the jupyter notebook.

- [Python introduction based on the class's MATLAB tutorial](https://github.com/mstampfer/Coursera-Stanford-ML-Python/blob/master/Coursera%20Stanford%20ML%20Python%20wiki.ipynb): This is the equivalent of class's MATLAB tutorial, in python.
