# NumPy 

NumPy (or Numpy) is a Linear Algebra Library for Python, the reason it is so important for Data Science with Python is that almost all of the libraries in the PyData Ecosystem rely on NumPy as one of their main building blocks.

Numpy is also incredibly fast, as it has bindings to C libraries. For more info on why you would want to use Arrays instead of lists, check out this great [StackOverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/993984/why-numpy-instead-of-python-lists).


Numpy has many built-in functions and capabilities. 

Some of the most important aspects of Numpy are: 
- vectors,
- arrays,
- matrices, and 
- number generation.
